# BYOB Headless Block Parser

This plugin converts links inside Gutenberg blocks that point to backend WordPress pages and posts to work in the frontend Next.js app.

E.g. "https://wordpress-backend.example.com/hello-world" -> "https://nextjs-frontend.example.com/hello-world"

Forked from https://github.com/kellenmace/headless-block-parser.
